# Client Terminal 
This was a coding exercise I did for exec thread. The exercise was to setup a client controlled terminal.

I had a Dougie Houser theme to the terminal and another fun easter egg command. See READ_ME.txt for commands.

I will be updating this readme in the future with more direction, but for now..

npm install 
npm start

Open your browser to localhost:3000
